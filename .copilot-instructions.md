# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Orchestra API

## Development Workflow

### Always Use Small Commits & PRs
- Create feature branch for each change
- One logical change per commit
- Descriptive conventional commit messages
- Create PR even for small improvements

### Branch Strategy
```
feature/api-endpoint-name
fix/specific-bug-description  
docs/api-documentation
refactor/service-cleanup
```

### Before Making Changes
1. Check git status
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
3. Plan atomic commits

### Commit Message Format
```
feat(workshops): add workshop status endpoint

- Add GET /workshops/{id}/status route
- Include pod status and resource usage
- Update OpenAPI schema
- Add comprehensive error handling
```

### Type Safety Workflow
- Regenerate OpenAPI schema after model changes: `just generate-schema`
- Update frontend types: `just update-frontend-types`
- Test API changes before committing

### Quality Checks
- Run `just quality` before commits
- Include tests for new endpoints
- Update documentation

### Multi-Repo Coordination
- API changes may affect:
  - orchestra-frontend (types, endpoints)
  - orchestra-operator (CRD interactions)
- Mention cross-repo impacts in PR descriptions
